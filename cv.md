## About me
My current job is not related to development and IT. In 2021 received a master's degree in civil engineering. As a hobby I studied different areas of development: game-development on C# with Unity, QA, Java, and now trying frontend-development. My current purpose is to change job. I liked front-ent development because it has an element of creativity and chance create something that can help solve someone's problem.

## Skills and Proficiency:

## Code example:
*Given a non-negative integer **n**, write a function **to_binary/ToBinary** which returns that number in a binary format.*

}
```
